Anna has chosen this structure of meals to allow for meal prep and to help you save money on grocery shopping. If the meals are different every day, meal prep is not possible and this would also result in very high grocery costs. However, if you would like a different meal than what is suggested, there is an “Alternate Meals” section where you can pick from other meal options! The meals sets will change every two weeks.",
            "How many calories are in the meals?",
            "One of the best features about Fit Body with Anna Victoria is that the meal portions and calories are custom to your needs!

For example, if you need 1750 calories, it will put you in the 1700-1800 calorie range.",

            "Why do I need to create a second instagram account to join the community?",
            "The reason is very simple: because in Anna's experience of helping thousands of women transform their lives and their bodies, these women are much more likely to see success when a part of the community. If someone uses their personal account, they are much less likely to share their struggles so openly and honestly since family and friends are watching. Joining the community gives you a safe place to track your journey and to be held accountable. 83% of women see more success when joining the community!
